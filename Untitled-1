Quanitify the Ca ions that are coordinating with residues, with membrane lipids (POPC or POPS), and ions that bridge residues and lipids
Consider monovalent ions as a control

check disordered pHLIP protonation...
mask = ~np.isnan(varx) & ~np.isnan(vary)
slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(varx[mask], vary[mask])

Make sure the fitting is done to linear data, not log-log data.
Produce synthetic fbm data and process it
Evaluate the mathematica nonlinearfit to develop a better comparison to python
Make sure all the scale bars are the same in python and mathematica

Develop tools to evaluate the coordination of ions and lipids
Color the phosphates of POPC and POPS differently
