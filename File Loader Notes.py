# todo Step 1:  Load a .json file, a corresponding .tif file, set an output directory,
# todo          and take in initial inputs for the file
# //   Step 2:  Convert the .json file into a numpy array, find and fill any blank spots with a NaN value
# todo Step 3:  Grab the first frame of the .tif file and display, plot all tracks on top of .tif
# todo          (color code by length), and provide relevant stats, such as number of frames and length of trajectory.
# todo          Leave room for future to adjust .tif picture quality (brightness, contrast, etc.)
# todo Step 4:  Take in manual inputs for box corners with which to select points, turning them 'on' or 'off'
# todo          for future calculations, dim them on the plot to indicate status
# todo Step 5:  With selected points, calculate RMSD and plot, for all tracks
# todo NOTE     Make sure there are relevant outputs produced at each step into a useful folder name,
# todo          consider toggling these outputs somehow
