#
# todo Step 1: Load a .json file, a corresponding .tif file, set an output directory, and take in initial inputs for the file
# todo Step 2: Convert the .json file into a numpy array, find and fill any blank spots with a NaN value
# todo Step 3: Grab the first frame of the .tif file and display, plot all tracks on top of .tif (color code by length), and provide relevant stats
# todo         such as number of frames and length of trajectory.  Leave room for future to adjust .tif picture quality (brightness, contrast, etc.)
# todo Step 4: Take in manual inputs for box corners with which to select points, turning them 'on' or 'off' for future calculations, dim them on
# todo         the plot to indicate status
# todo Step 5: With selected points, calculate RMSD and plot, for all tracks
# todo NOTE    Make sure there are relevant outputs produced at each step into a useful folder name, consider toggling these outputs somehow
