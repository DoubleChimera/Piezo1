Instructions:   DON'T EDIT the file_loader.py file, it is a dependency of track_selector.py
                Edit the track_selector.py at "__name__" = "__main__" near end of the file, look for User Inputs
                This will output to your save path.
                In the 'Selected_tracks' folder, a .json of useable tracks will be generated
                Use this .json for all the 'stat_xxxx.py' files
